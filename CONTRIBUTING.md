# Contributing  

All contributions are welcome!  

## Interacting with Discussions and Issues

Please read, and adhere to, our [code of conduct](https://github.com/j-m/grid/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  
A "contribution" is any active interaction with this repository.
You must read and agree to those terms before contributing; you may view this repository and use the product without doing so.  

## Feature requests

If you have an idea that isn't listed on our [Roadmap project](https://github.com/j-m/grid/projects/1), please start a [new discussion](https://github.com/j-m/grid/discussions/new).

## Bug reports

If you've spotted something funky, let us know!  
Please check for [existing issues](https://github.com/j-m/grid/issues), first.  
If one exists, please üëçüèª the first post of the issue - this way we can gauge the impact of the bug.  
Otherwise, please [raise a new issue](https://github.com/j-m/grid/issues/new).
If in doubt, just raise one anyway, but please don't be offended if we close your issue as a duplicate.

## Vulnerability reports

Please read our [Security Policy](https://github.com/j-m/grid/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

## Development

If you'd like to contribute to source code, tests, deployment, or otherwise, please let us know before starting work - we may have already started work on it, and it would be a shame to duplicate effort (especially if your solution is better).  
Pop a comment on the relevant issue or, if you're not sure, [start a discussion](https://github.com/j-m/grid/discussions/new).  
We greatly appreciate any support you can give; whether it's as little as adjusting the CSS, to implementing all of "multiplayer" for us - everything takes time.

## Thank you! ‚ô•
